# ðŸ’° Financial Analysis and Investment Platform

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive financial analysis and investment platform that empowers users with data-driven insights and a risk-free environment to learn about the US stock market. The project is a full-stack web application that integrates with various financial APIs to provide real-time data, historical performance, and advanced analytics.

## Key Features

### Stock & ETF Tracker
Search for any US-listed stock or ETF to view its real-time price, historical performance, and key metrics.

### Simulated Portfolio
A dashboard where users can manage a virtual portfolio, track their simulated gains and losses, and understand the impact of their investment decisions without financial risk.

### Fund Analysis
A section dedicated to comparing different investment funds, including mutual funds and ETFs. It displays key metrics like expense ratios and historical returns. For hedge funds, it provides a researched historical overview due to data limitations.

### Financial Modeling & Forecasting
An automated tool that generates a company's financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow Statement) from a single ticker symbol. It also includes a basic machine learning model for price forecasting.

### AI-Powered News & Sentiment
An integrated NLP system that fetches the latest financial news for a stock, summarizes the articles, and provides a sentiment score (positive, neutral, or negative) to help users gauge market mood.

## Data Resources & Limitations

### Stock & ETF Data
All data is sourced from reliable financial APIs with free access tiers.

### Mutual Funds
Data is sourced from public financial websites and is limited to publicly available information.

### Hedge Funds
Due to data being proprietary, this section is a static analysis of historical performance based on publicly available filings and research. It does not provide real-time data.

### F&O (Futures & Options)
Due to the high cost of real-time options data, this section is a conceptual demonstration.
